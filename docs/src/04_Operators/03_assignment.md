### Converting Minutes to Days and Years

This tutorial will guide you through writing a C program that converts a given number of minutes into days and years. The primary focus of this exercise is to familiarize you with the arithmetic operators in C and the use of the `scanf` function for user input.

#### Step 1: Understanding the Problem

The task is to convert a given number of minutes into an equivalent number of days and years. Since a year and a day consist of more minutes than are typically entered by the user, the result will be a fractional value. For this reason, we will use floating-point variables to store our results.

#### Step 2: Define the Variables

We will define the following variables:

- `minutes`: to store the number of minutes entered by the user (integer type).
- `years`, `days`: to store the calculated number of years and days (double type).
- `minutes_in_year`: a constant to store the number of minutes in a year (double type).
- `minutes_in_day`: a constant to store the number of minutes in a day (double type).

#### Step 3: Calculate the Constants

We need to calculate the total number of minutes in a year and a day:

- Minutes in an hour: 60
- Hours in a day: 24
- Days in a year: 365 (we will ignore leap years for simplicity)

Thus:

- `minutes_in_day = 60 * 24`
- `minutes_in_year = 60 * 24 * 365`

#### Step 4: Reading Input

We will use the `scanf` function to read the number of minutes from the user.

#### Step 5: Performing the Calculations

To convert minutes to years and days:

- `years = minutes / minutes_in_year`
- Remaining minutes after converting to years can be calculated using the modulus operator `%`.
- `days = remaining_minutes / minutes_in_day`

#### Step 6: Output the Results

We will use the `printf` function to display the results.

### Implementation

Here is the complete implementation of the program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Variable declarations
    int minutes;
    double years, days;
    const double minutes_in_day = 60 * 24;
    const double minutes_in_year = 60 * 24 * 365;

    // Prompting the user for input
    printf("Enter the number of minutes: ");
    scanf("%d", &minutes);

    // Calculating years
    years = minutes / minutes_in_year;

    // Calculating remaining minutes after converting to years
    int remaining_minutes = minutes % (int)minutes_in_year;

    // Calculating days from the remaining minutes
    days = remaining_minutes / minutes_in_day;

    // Displaying the result
    printf("%d minutes is approximately %.2f years and %.2f days.\n", minutes, years, days);

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Variable Declarations**:

   - `minutes` is an integer to store the input.
   - `years` and `days` are doubles to store the calculated years and days.
   - `minutes_in_day` and `minutes_in_year` are constants representing the total number of minutes in a day and a year, respectively.
2. **User Input**:

   - The program prompts the user to enter the number of minutes.
   - The `scanf` function reads this input and stores it in the `minutes` variable.
3. **Calculations**:

   - The total number of years is calculated by dividing the input minutes by the number of minutes in a year.
   - The remaining minutes after converting to years are calculated using the modulus operator.
   - The number of days is calculated by dividing the remaining minutes by the number of minutes in a day.
4. **Output**:

   - The `printf` function displays the results with the number of years and days formatted to two decimal places.

### Conclusion

This program demonstrates the use of arithmetic operators and the `scanf` function for user input in C. By following this tutorial, you will gain a better understanding of how to perform basic arithmetic operations and handle user inputs, which are fundamental skills in C programming.
